# GNOME 3 Fork
GNOME 40 is the biggest change to GNOME since GNOME 3. Some like it, but some, like me, don't.

Many didn't like GNOME 3 when _it_ came out. GNOME 2 was even forked to MATE.
Over ten years, we got used to GNOME 3, and I actually liked it.

But just like how people didn't like GNOME 3 when it came out, people don't like GNOME 40 either.

And that's why I wanted to fork GNOME 3. All we need is a name.
