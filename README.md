# GNOME 3 Fork

GNOME 40 is the biggest change to GNOME since GNOME 3. Some like it, but some, like me, don't.

Many didn't like GNOME 3 when _it_ came out. GNOME 2 was even forked to MATE.
Over ten years, we got used to GNOME 3, and I actually liked it.

But just like how people didn't like GNOME 3 when it came out, people don't like GNOME 40 either.

And that's why I wanted to fork GNOME 3.38. All we need is a name.

To help contribute to the development of the project, go to [its repository on GitHub](https://github.com/JPcode05/gnome-3-fork).
I have already forked [gnome-shell](https://github.com/JPcode05/gnome-shell).

Future plans:
* Fork some other GNOME applications
* GTK4 support, like MATE added GTK3
* Qt and EFL support
* No dependency on systemd, can use on BSD
* Move repository to Codeberg/Sourcehut (and GitHub remains secondary).
